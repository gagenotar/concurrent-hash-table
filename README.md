# Concurrent Hash Table

This project implements a concurrent hash table in C for COP 4600.
It is designed to help students visualize concurrency concepts.

## üöÄ Features
- Implements read-write locks
- Utilizes condition variables
- Uses pthread library for threading

## üèÅ Getting Started

### üõ†Ô∏è Compilation

#### Windows
1. Open the terminal from the project folder.
2. Run the command: `mingw32-make`
3. To run the compiled file, use: `chash.exe`

#### Linux
1. Open the terminal from the project folder.
2. Run the command: `make`
3. To run the compiled file, use: `./chash`

## üìñ Usage

### ‚öôÔ∏è General
1. Ensure that `commands.txt` is in the same directory as the executable.
2. Run the executable (`chash.exe` on Windows or `./chash` on Linux).
3. The program will read the commands from `commands.txt` and output the results to `output.txt`.

### üìÑ Commands and Output files

#### Commands File
The `commands.txt` file contains a list of commands that the program will execute. Each command should be on a new line. The format of the commands is as follows:
- `insert <key> <value>`: Inserts a key-value pair into the hash table.
- `delete <key> 0`: Deletes the key-value pair associated with the given key.
- `search <key> 0`: Retrieves the value associated with the given key.

Example `commands.txt`:
```
threads,10,0
insert,Richard Garriot,40000
insert,Sid Meier,50000
insert,Shigeru Miyamoto,51000
delete,Sid Meier,0
insert,Hideo Kojima,45000
insert,Gabe Newell,49000
insert,Roberta Williams,45900
delete,Richard Garriot,0
insert,Carol Shaw,41000
search,Sid Meier,0
```

#### Output File
The `output.txt` file contains the results of the commands executed by the program. Each result corresponds to a command from the `commands.txt` file. The format of the output is as follows:
- For `insert` commands, the output will include the thread ID, the operation, the key, and the value.
- For `delete` commands, the output will include the thread ID, the operation, and the key.
- For `search` commands, the output will include the thread ID, the operation, and the result (`NOT FOUND` if the key does not exist, otherwise the key and value).
- Additionally, the output will include information about lock acquisitions and releases.
- Lastly, the final state of the table will be output, sorted by hash value.

Example `output.txt`:
```
